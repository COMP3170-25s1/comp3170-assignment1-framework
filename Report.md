## Scene Graph (5%)
Include a drawing (pen-and-paper or digital) of the scene graph used in your project.

## Mesh illustrations (5%)
Include illustrations of <b>all</b> the meshes used in your project, drawn to scale in model coordinates, including:
* The origin
* The X and Y axes
* The coordinates of each vertex
* The triangles that make the mesh

## World camera calculations (10%)
Include a diagram illustrating the world camera calculations, including:
* The viewport rectangle
* The mapping from view (camera centric) coordinates to NDC
* The mapping from NDC to viewport (pixel) coordinates

The diagram should follow the below format, but with values relevant to your project:
